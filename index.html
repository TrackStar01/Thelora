      <p><strong>Thelora</strong> is a realm shaped by the Loom—a divine weave of memory, prophecy, and time. Its lands shimmer with ancient echoes, and every soul is a thread in the tapestry of fate. Seasons bend, stars whisper, and the past is never truly gone.</p>

      <h2>The Loom</h2>
      <p>Neither god nor machine, the Loom pulses beneath reality. It binds seasons to stone, dreams to rivers, and destinies to stars. Those who walk its threads may glimpse what was... or what may yet be.</p>
