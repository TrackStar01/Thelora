      <p>The Sable Reaches are all that remain of a landmass shattered in a past Breaking — a scatter of islands adrift in the Azure Sea, 
        bound together by fog, ruin, and memory. Their cliffs are jagged slabs of gray and black stone, the torn edges of mountains that once touched the sky. 
        The forests that cling to them are wind-gnarled and silent, their roots gripping ancient walls now half-buried in the surf.</p>

      <p>Time falters here. Some islands hold dawn while others remain in endless dusk, and travelers sometimes meet themselves walking the same beach an hour apart. 
        The Reaches are dotted with the remains of cities drowned and lifted again, their spires rising from shallow waves like broken teeth.</p>

      <p><em>"Once a kingdom. Once a continent. Now just memory and stone."</em></p>

  <h3 class="site-name">Caer’Morath</h3>
  <p class="site-description">
    Once the heart of a great kingdom, Caer’Morath now stands as a monument to a world undone. The city clings to the central island’s cliffs, its upper spires jutting from the fog like broken teeth while the lower streets lie perfectly preserved beneath the sea.
  </p>
  <p class="site-description">
    On calm days, sunlight pierces the water just enough to reveal mosaics, archways, and towers gleaming faintly with trapped Weave-light. Some say the city’s submerged heart still pulses, beating in rhythm with the tide.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="panel open">
  <h3 class="site-name">The Temple of the Light</h3>
  <p class="site-description">
    Hidden on the northern island, this vast temple rises from the sea only during the lowest tides. 
    Its blackened columns emerge dripping with salt and lichen, and the carved reliefs along its walls still catch the faintest glimmer of gold beneath the grime.
  </p>
  <p class="site-description">
    The temple once worshiped the dawn — a monument to illumination and renewal — but the sun never reaches it now. 
    When the tide returns, the sea swallows the structure in silence, leaving the water above it glowing faintly, as if lit from within.
