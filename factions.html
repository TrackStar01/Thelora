    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2 class="fade-in">Religious Schisms</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">Not all who honor the Creator agree on the Weave’s purpose. Splinter sects have emerged—some believe the Seal must be broken to achieve true salvation, while others secretly revere the Dark One as a misunderstood liberator. These schisms fuel conflict across regions, with hidden temples, rogue prophets, and corrupted rituals surfacing in unexpected places.</p>
