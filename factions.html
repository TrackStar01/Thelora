    <h1>Factions & Orders</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Religious Schisms</h2>
      <p>Not all who honor the Creator agree on the Weave’s purpose. Splinter sects have emerged—some believe the Seal must be broken to achieve true salvation, while others secretly revere the Dark One as a misunderstood liberator.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dawn’s Purge</h2>
      <p>A zealot order of paladins, fighters, and inquisitors who believe magic itself corrupts the Weave. Their mission is to eradicate all magic users, including the Champion and Weaveborn. They view magical power as a threat that must be “cleansed.”</p>
      <p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A broken sun pierced by a sword.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Order of the Flame Unbroken</h2>
      <p>Loyalists to the Creator’s vision, this secretive order works to protect the Seal and assist the Champion. Their hidden cells operate in cities, often mistaken for harmless monks or religious zealots.</p>
      <p><strong>Symbol:</strong> An endless knot of flame.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ascendant Circle</h2>
      <p>A powerful and enigmatic group of spellcasters who study the mysteries of the Weave. Feared and revered in equal measure, some within the Circle seek to control the Seal’s power, while others prepare for the Coming Unraveling.</p>
      <p><strong>Symbol:</strong> A spiral of stars surrounding a black void.</p>
