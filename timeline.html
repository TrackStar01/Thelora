    <h1>Timeline of Theoria</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Pre-Weave Era</h2>
      <p>Before the Loom’s awakening, Theoria was fragmented—its regions isolated, its magic wild and untethered. Ancient ruins hint at proto-thread rituals and forgotten gods.</p>

      <h2>The Loom’s Emergence</h2>
      <p>Scholars mark the First Pulse as the moment the Loom began binding memory to matter. Threadmarks appeared, and prophecy became a tangible force.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>The Weaveborn Awakening</h2>
      <p>Your campaign begins here. The party awakens in the Grove of Four Seasons, each bearing a threadmark. The Loom pulses unnaturally, and regions begin to stir.</p>
