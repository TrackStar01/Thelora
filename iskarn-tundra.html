      <p>The Iskarn Tundra is a land of frozen silence, where endless plains of snow and jagged ice stretch beneath a sky that rarely softens. 
        The wind carries the weight of ages, whispering across glaciers that grind slowly toward the sea. 
        Ancient ruins lie half-buried in frost, their stones cracked by centuries of cold, their halls echoing with the memory of voices long gone.</p>

      <p>To wander here is to feel the world pause—time itself slowed by the grip of winter. 
      Hunters and nomads move lightly across the tundra, guided by stars and the faint shimmer of auroras that dance above the horizon. 
      Yet beneath the stillness lies danger: sudden storms that erase all paths, beasts adapted to the endless night, and the quiet pull of the Weave where frost and silence converge.</p>

     <p>The Iskarn Tundra is not merely barren—it is a threshold. 
      Those who endure its silence speak of visions in the snow, of truths revealed when the world is stripped to its bones. 
      It is a place where survival becomes reverence, and every breath feels borrowed from the ancient cold.</p>

      <p><em>"The Loom here is brittle, and power sleeps beneath the ice."</em></p>

    <h3 class="site-name">Varrik’s Hold</h3>
    <p class="site-description">
      The geothermal activity from volcanic vents under the mountains makes it the most habitable area in the region. The settlement is partly underground, warmed by natural steam vents, and serves as the Ascendant Circle’s primary base of operations in Iskarn.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="panel open">
    <h3 class="site-name">Frostspire Bastion</h3>
    <p class="site-description">
      The shattered fortress is suspended mid-collapse between the cliffs, frozen in time by Weave anomalies. It acts as both a dungeon site and a landmark visible for miles when the aurora flares.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="panel open">
    <h3 class="site-name">The Crystal Fields</h3>
    <p class="site-description">
      The open plains here reflect the light from the aurora and the Frozen Weave beneath, creating vast crystalline hexes of ice. The region is largely uninhabitable but beautiful — a dangerous expanse for travelers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="panel open">
    <h3 class="site-name">The Luminous Maw</h3>
    <p class="site-description">The Luminous Maw is a vast chasm that glows with eerie radiance, as if the Weave itself has been torn open. 
      Its shifting light reveals ancient bones and ruins, a beacon both beautiful and terrifying. Major Weave fracture site</p>
